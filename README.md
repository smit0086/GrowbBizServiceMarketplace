## Steps to Run the DB and Backend

1. In the backend directory, run `./mvnw install`.
2. After successful compilation and build, go to the root directory of the repository and run `docker-compose build`.
3. After docker images are built successfully, run `docker-compose up`.
4. Before testing the APIs, `roles` table has to be populated -
    1. Roles table can be populated using the following steps -
        1. `docker container exec -it mysql_db /bin/bash`
        2. `$ mysql -u root -p growbiz`
        3. Enter the password, which is test123.
        4. Run the following INSERT statements -
         ```sql
         -- Populate user roles table
         INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_ADMIN');
         INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_CUSTOMER');
         INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_BUSINESS_OWNER');
         ```
